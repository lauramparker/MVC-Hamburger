## MVC Hamburger
 _An Express / MySQL / Handlebars Application_
 
 ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/LICENSE-MIT-blue)



>   MVC-Hamburger is a Node CRUD application with a SQL database and Handlebars template engine. This application was my first example of standard model-view-control architecture. It allows a user to create and track a list of favorite burgers.  When a burger is added to the list, it appears on the left side list of burgers "Not Yet Devoured"; and, when the "Devour It" button is clicked, the named burger moves to the "Devoured It" list on the right-side. The application contains a schema for burgers to be added and then devoured (changing the burger's devoured status upon user action). It also leverages node.js/express for routing; and, uses handlebars to create the view templates.
